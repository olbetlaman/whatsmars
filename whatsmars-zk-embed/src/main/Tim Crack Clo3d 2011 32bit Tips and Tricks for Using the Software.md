You can import a 3D avatar from the library or from your own files. CLO3D supports various file formats such as OBJ, FBX, ZPR and AXT. You can also customize the avatar's body shape, pose and measurements using the tools on the right panel.

Step 3: Draw 2D patterns and arrange them on the avatar
 
To create a 3D garment, you need to draw 2D patterns and arrange them on the avatar. You can use the tools on the top toolbar to draw various shapes of patterns, such as rectangle, circle, polygon and free curve. You can also edit the patterns by adding or deleting points, curves and lines.
 
Once you have drawn the patterns, you need to arrange them on the avatar. You can use the arrangement points on the 2D window to snap the patterns to the corresponding parts of the avatar. You can also use the gizmo tool to move, rotate and scale the patterns on the 3D window.
 
Step 4: Simulate the 3D garment and adjust the fit
 
After arranging the patterns on the avatar, you can simulate the 3D garment by clicking on the play button on the bottom toolbar. The simulation will show how the fabric drapes and fits on the avatar. You can pause, resume and reset the simulation at any time.
 
You can adjust the fit of the 3D garment by using the tools on the left panel. You can sew the patterns together by selecting the edges and clicking on the sew tool. You can also use the pin tool to fix the patterns to a certain position on the avatar. You can also use the pressure tool to create tight or loose areas on the garment.
