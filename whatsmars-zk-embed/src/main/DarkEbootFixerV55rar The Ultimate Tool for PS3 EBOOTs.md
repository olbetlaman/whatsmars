## Requirements
 
- A PC with Windows OS
- A PS3 with CFW installed
- A USB drive formatted in FAT32
- DarkEboot Fixer v5.5 (you can download it from [here](https://psjailbreak.ru/2012/12/13/darkeboot-fixer-v30-for-355-cfw.html))
- PkgView (included in DarkEboot Fixer v5.5)
- The PS3 game or homebrew that you want to sign (in .PKG or folder format)

## Steps

1. Extract the DarkEboot Fixer v5.5 archive to a folder on your PC, for example C:\DarkEbootFixer.
2. Copy the PS3 game or homebrew that you want to sign to the same folder.
3. If the game or homebrew is in .PKG format, you need to extract its contents using PkgView. To do this, run DarkEbootFixer\_ENG.exe, then enter 10 (PKG Utility), then enter 1 (Open PkgView). Select the .PKG file and click Extract All. Alternatively, you can enter 3 (Extract PKG) and type the name of the .PKG file with its extension.
4. To sign the game or homebrew for CFW 3.55, run DarkEbootFixer\_ENG.exe, then enter 1 (Content ID Utility). If the game or homebrew is in folder format, enter 1 (Get Content ID from EBOOT.BIN) and select the EBOOT.BIN file from the folder. If the game or homebrew is in .PKG format, enter 2 (Get Content ID from PKG) and select the .PKG file. Note down the Content ID that is displayed.
5. Enter 0 (Back) to return to the main menu, then enter 2 (Fix EBOOT.BIN for CFW 3.55). Select the EBOOT.BIN file from the game or homebrew folder, then type the Content ID that you noted down in step 4. The program will create a new EBOOT.BIN file that is signed for CFW 3.55.
6. If the game or homebrew has other files that need to be signed, such as .self or .sprx files, you can use options 3 (Fix SELF File for CFW 3.55) and 4 (Fix SPRX File for CFW 3.55) respectively. Select the files that you want to sign and type the Content ID as before.
7. If you want to create a new .PKG file from the signed game or homebrew, you can use option 9 (Create New PKG File). Enter a name for the new .PKG file, then select the folder that contains the signed game or homebrew. The program will create a new .PKG file that is ready to be installed on your PS3.
8. Copy the signed game or homebrew folder or .PKG file to your USB drive.
9. Connect your USB drive to your PS3 and install the .PKG file using Install Package Files option from XMB, or copy the folder to your PS3 hard drive using a file manager such as Multiman.
10. Enjoy your signed game or homebrew on your PS3 with CFW!
